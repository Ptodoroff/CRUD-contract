# CRUD-contract
A contract with functions that can create,read,update and delete data.


This Dapp utilizes my knowledge of the following instruments:

HTML and Bootstrap for the front-end 
2.Javascript and Web3.js library for communication between the frontend and the smart contract
3.Webpack for bundling
4.Mocha and Truffle for testing and deployment to Ropsten Testnet
5.Solidity for the Smart contract
